        <h2>Our Weekend Camping</h2>
        <p>Posted on May 12, 2025 by Roop</p>
        <p>We arrived there a little before lunch. First thing we did was put some tarp down so we could eat lunch. After lunch, we put up one of the tents,but the inside was super sandy (because we had used that tent for the beach a few years before). So, we put a tarp inside the tent so <strong>WE</strong> dont get sandy. We played all that afternoon. We played stuff like <i>UNO</i> and <i>Taco Cat Goat Cheese Pizza</i> and a few others. That night, we sat and talked, all the kids in the campiste with all the adults by the road. It was me and my friends Aarush, Vedish and Lihan talking.When we slept, a raccoon disturbed us while trying to get the trash. Several times we got up and saw the thing, and it didn't manage to get the trash because we'd hung it up earlier. Then, all of us had to pee in the middle of the night, so we got out of the tent and went to a restroom compound(there were no restrooms at our campsite). The next morning, we went on a nature trail displaying the beach, and also went to the beach itself. After we got back to the campsite, the parents started cleaning up all the tents and tarp while we played more games. Then, we had a final grill (chicken thighs) and left. This all occured the weekend before my school finals.</i></p>
        <p>We had a blast at the beach, grilling, and playing games. Here's to more outdoor adventures!</p>
