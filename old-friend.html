        <h2>Some time with an old friend!!</h2>
        <p>Posted on Jun 10, 2025 by BPDABEST</p>   
        <p>I got there on Friday night, at around 11:00. Bavyan(my old friend) was asleep, seeing as it was late. The next morning, when I woke up, he told me that he had been waiting for me to roll for a fruit on Blox Fruits. So he rolled. What do you think he rolled? a... <strong>KITSUNE!!!</strong> Im just kidding. He wishes though. He rolled a spring. He waited ALL NIGT to roll a spring. Anyways, we started talking, fooling around, doing the stuff we usually did. Then, our parents came and said we had to take a shower, cuz we were going for a hike. That happen all three days, thogh the hikes got constantly easier. We most often took homemade food to the place where we hiked, ate, then went on the hike. Then, we came home and played outside, then we played Roblox. It's funner than it sounds. Really.</p>
