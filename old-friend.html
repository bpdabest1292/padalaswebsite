        <h2>Some time with an old friend!!</h2>
        <p>Posted on Jun 10, 2025 by BPDABEST</p>   
        <p>I got there on Friday night, at around 11:00. Bavyan(my old friend) was asleep, seeing as it was late. The next morning, when I woke up, he told me that he had been waiting for me to roll for a fruit on Blox Fruits. So he rolled. What do you think he rolled? a... <strong>KITSUNE!!!</strong> Im just kidding. He wishes though. He rolled a spring. He waited ALL NIGT to roll a spring. Anyways, we started talking, fooling around, doing the stuff we usually did. Then, our parents came and said we had to take a shower, cuz we were going for a hike. That happen all three days, thogh the hikes got constantly easier. We most often took homemade food to the place where we hiked, ate, then went on the hike. Then, we came home and played outside, then we played Roblox. It's funner than it sounds. Really.</p>

The boys wear casual summer clothing and baseball caps, and are smiling and relaxed. The environment is sunny with blue sky, green grass, and some shade from a tree overhead. The mood is friendly and cheerful." />

One child in a pink shirt holds a box with two donuts, another in a green shirt and shorts holds an empty box, and the third in a yellow shirt and green shorts points at the empty box. The shop interior features tiled floors, tables, chairs, and large windows with visible signage including Krusty Kreme branding and hiring notices. The children appear cheerful and engaged." width="350">

Most are children and teens, some with arms around each other, dressed in casual summer clothing. The environment is peaceful and natural, with green foliage and reflections on the water. The emotional tone is warm and friendly." />
